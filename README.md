# COVID-19-Socio_Economic_Analysis
Analysis by Machine Learning

Introduction:
The UN’s Framework for the Immediate Socio-Economic Response to the COVID 19 Crisis warns that “The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from county to county, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a state to country scale.

In this Jupyter Notebook, we will use a dataset which has been constructed from data about Median Household Income, Poverty, Unemployment and COVID cases and deaths in USA at state and county level from 6 datasets from census.gov and usda.gov. This analysis will perform machine learning analysis.

Liberaries:

Matplolib has been used for visualizations and SKLearn multiple liberaries have been used for machine learning models.
